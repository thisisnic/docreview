*An opinionated package for enhancing your R package documentation.*

When writing R packages, high quality documentation can make for a great
experience for your users.

You can use **docreview** to check that your R package documentation
passes a number of checks relating to function documentation and
vignette quality.

## Installation

You can install docreview from CRAN

``` r
install.packages("docreview")
```

If youâ€™d like access to the most up-to-date features, you can install
the development version from GitHhub.

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("thisisnic/docreview")
```

## Usage

``` r
library(docreview)
pkg_path <- system.file("testpkg", package = "docreview")

# ensure you have rebuilt your vignettes if you want to run checks requiring the HTML files
tools::buildVignettes(dir = pkg_path, quiet = TRUE)

# Review docs in the package
package_review(path = pkg_path)
```

See [the
vignette](https://thisisnic.github.io/docreview/articles/docreview.html)
for more detailed usage guides.

## Current default review checks

-   Vignettes have no more than 2000 words (warn) or 3000 words (fail)
-   Vignettes have no fewer than 100 words (warn) or 0 words (fail)
-   Vignettes have a Flesch-Kincaid readability score lower than 50
    (warn) or 30 (fail)
